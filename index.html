        * gulp was released 1.5yrs after grunt in July 2013

        # Things Gulp is not so good at.

        * Streams transforms are built around transforming files 1:1, n:n/1:n/n:1 difficult.
        * Cannot concatenate streams together with source maps.
        * Need to use 4 plugins together for incremental rebuilds.

        * Source maps not working.
        * Uses the filesystem for everything so plugins must clean up after themselves.
        * Everything sequential, can't parallelise.
        * Brocfile.js files are verbose, many lines per transformation.

        * Production source maps.

        # sigh

        * Functional Reactive Programming (sloth hugging kitten)
        * n:n operations: in sigh each event is an array of files rather than a single file.
        * Does not use fs except when absolutely necessary.
        * Source maps from minified/transpiled files back to original sources.
        * Very neat Assetfile.js syntax.
        * Like lodash of streams (flatten, reduce etc.)

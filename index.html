        * It's not an asset pipeline, it's a task runner.

        # Gulp

        * gulp was released 1.5yrs after grunt in July 2013
        * pipelines are node streams
        * plugins are (mostly) stream transforms, 1 source file in 1 destination file out.

        # Things Gulp is not so good at.

        * Streams transforms are built around transforming files 1:1, n:n/1:n/n:1 difficult.
        * Cannot concatenate streams together with source maps.
        * Need to use 4 plugins together for incremental rebuilds.
        * Show screenshot of https://twitter.com/tomdale/status/435463584085049344

        * Kills cat.
        * Example from [here](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/) PIPE PIPE PIPE POPEYE
        * Should I care I'm using streams and really have to write pipe so much?

        * First release May 2013
        * Currently in beta
        * Plugins take one or more trees (filesystem directories).
        * Output one or more trees (containing built assets).

        * Source maps not working.
        * Use of filesystem means plugins must clean-up.
        * Everything sequential, can't parallelise: "only a 40% speed gain".
        * Brocfile.js files can get verbose.up

        # sigh

        * Functional Reactive Programming (sloth hugging kitten)
        * n:n operations: in sigh each event is an array of files rather than a single file.
        * Does not use fs except when absolutely necessary.
        * Source maps from minified/transpiled files back to original sources.
        * Very neat Assetfile.js syntax.
        * Like lodash of streams (flatten, reduce etc.)
